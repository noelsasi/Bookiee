Bookiee is a simple Web Application with CRUD operations with three tables Users, Authors and Books.
 
 Setup need for this Bookiee Application
 - NodeJS

 Experience It.
 - Do npm install to install all dependencies. 
 - This is a web application whcih I've built in the process of learning NodeJs with Express Framework during my Internship.
 - So, I've made this setup very easy with Yeoman Generator. install express, select mvc, pug, postgres and finally Gulp.
 - Install Postgres and PgAdmin and connect to the application in config/config.js with host and password
 - It's really interesting doing CRUD operations fetchnig the data from controllers to pug.
 - I've used ES6 promises and map functions.
 - PassportJs for Authentication which is pretty simple with minimal coding
 - have IsLoggedin function which allows you through the route only if you're loggedin. 
 - Ajax made simple to avoid the pages from loading and refresh.
